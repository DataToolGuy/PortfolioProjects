👋 Hi, I’m the DataToolGuy. 
I build tools that help folks understand data.

To build those data tools I use:
- SQL: (Especially Microsoft's SQL Server's variety, TSQL. I've worked with MySQL's version of SQL, and Microsoft Accesses versions of SQL as well.
- Python: Currently I'm currently learning Python.
  Python's power to build tools that manipulate data and build graphs is impressive.
I have also worked with VBA especially in Access and also some in Excel.
I have worked with with other languages including VB and the Web languages: JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS.
- And the desktop office tools for
  - spreadsheets: Excel (and Libre Office's Calc and Googles Sheet, which have some similar features).
  - documents: Word (and Libre Office's Write and Googles Docs).
  - databases: Access.
