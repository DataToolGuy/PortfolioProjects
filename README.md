👋 Hi, I’m the DataToolGuy. 
I build tools that help folks understand data.

To build those data tools I use:
- SQL: (Especially Microsoft's SQL Server's variety, TSQL.) I've worked with MySQL's version of SQL, and Microsoft Accesses versions of SQL as well. I've written stored procedures, functions and scipts to create and modify databases with DDL.
- Python: is my current go to language as I learn it. Having started ages ago in C, and used C++, VB, VBA and played around with others, I find Python impressive. Especially its power to build tools that manipulate data and build graphs from it's various modules.
I recently worked with VBA especially in Access and also some in Excel.
I have worked with with other languages including VB and the Web languages: JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS.
- And of course I've used the desktop office tools for
  - spreadsheets: Excel (and Libre Office's Calc and Googles Sheet, which have some similar features).
  - documents: Word (and Libre Office's Write and Googles Docs). 
  - databases: Access.
